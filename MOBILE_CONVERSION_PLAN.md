## Recommended Development Approach

### Option 1: React Native (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Code reuse from existing React components, cross-platform
- **Cons**: Some native features require platform-specific code
- **Timeline**: 3-4 months for full feature parity

### Option 2: Flutter
- **Pros**: High performance, excellent UI consistency
- **Cons**: Complete rewrite required, Dart learning curve
- **Timeline**: 4-6 months for full feature parity

### Option 3: Native Development
- **Pros**: Best performance, full platform integration
- **Cons**: Separate iOS/Android codebases, longer development time
- **Timeline**: 6-8 months for both platforms

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- Redux Toolkit or Zustand for global state
- React Query for server state management
- AsyncStorage for local persistence

### Navigation
- React Navigation 6 with stack, tab, and drawer navigators
- Deep linking for sharing disaster information
- Gesture-based navigation

### UI Framework
- React Native Elements or NativeBase
- Custom components matching current design
- Responsive design for tablets

### Data & APIs
- Supabase React Native client
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Offline-first data synchronization

## Feature Mapping
